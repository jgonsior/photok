# photok
We developed as part of the course [Advanced Web Programming](https://www.ida.liu.se/~TDDD27/) a fully functional photo contest application with authentication, photo upload etc. We used Flask for the REST backend, and Angular for the frontend. From the course description:
>Large-scale web development for interactive webb applications. Programming focus, state-of-the-art JavaScript Framework + Service Oriented (API) Backend. Not webdesign.
